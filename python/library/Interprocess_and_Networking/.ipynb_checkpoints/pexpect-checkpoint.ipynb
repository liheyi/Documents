    "The delaybeforesend helps overcome a weird behavior that many users were experiencing. The typical problem was that a user would expect() a “Password:” prompt and then immediately call sendline() to send the password. The user would then see that their password was echoed back to them. Passwords don’t normally echo. The problem is caused by the fact that most applications print out the “Password” prompt and then turn off stdin echo, but if you send your password before the application turned off echo, then you get your password echoed. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem when interacting with a human at a real keyboard. If you introduce a slight delay just before writing then this seems to clear up the problem. This was such a common problem for many users that I decided that the default pexpect behavior should be to sleep just before writing to the child application. 1/20th of a second (50 ms) seems to be enough to clear up the problem. You can set delaybeforesend to None to return to the old behavior."
