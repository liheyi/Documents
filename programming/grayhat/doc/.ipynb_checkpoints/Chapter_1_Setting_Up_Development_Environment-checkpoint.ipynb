The $\\textrm{oledll()}$ method operates exactly like the $\\textrm{windll()}$ method; however, it assumes that the exported functions return a $\\text{Windows HRESULT}$ error code, which is used specifically for error messages returned from Microsoft $\\text{Component Object Model (COM)}$ functions."
