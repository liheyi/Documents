The most common way is to use Newton’s method of successive approximations, which says that whenever we have a guess $y$ for the value of the square root of a number $x$, we can perform a simple manipulation to get a better guess (one closer to the actual square root) by averaging $y$ with $x/y$. For example, we\n",
