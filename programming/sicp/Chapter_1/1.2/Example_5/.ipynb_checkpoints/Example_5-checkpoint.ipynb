Therefore, the total number of ways to make change for some amount is equal to the number of ways to make change for the amount without using any of the first kind of coin, plus the number of ways to make change assuming that we do use the first kind of coin.

    "$count$-$change$ generates a $tree$-$recursive$ process with redundancies similar to those in our first implementation of $fib$. (It will take quite a while for that 292 to be computed.) On the other hand, it is not obvious how to design a better algorithm for computing the result, and we leave this problem as a challenge. The observation that a $tree$-$recursive$ process may be highly inefficient but often easy to specify and understand has led people to propose that one could get the best of both worlds by designing a “smart compiler” that could transform tree-recursive procedures into more efficient procedures that compute the same result."
