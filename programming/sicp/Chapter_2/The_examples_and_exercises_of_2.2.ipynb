    "The ability to create pairs whose elements are pairs is the essence of list structure’s importance as a representational tool. We refer to this ability as the $closure$ $property$ of $\\texttt{cons}$. In general, an operation for combining data objects satisfies the closure property if the results of combining things with that operation can themselves be combined using the same operation. $\\textrm{Closure}$ is the key to power in any means of combination because it permits us to create hierarchical structures-structures made up of parts, which themselves are made up of parts, and so on."

In this section, we take up the consequences of closure for compound data. We describe some conventional techniques for using $\\texttt{pairs}$ to represent $\\text{sequences}$ and $\\text{trees}$, and we exhibit a graphics language that illustrates closure in a vivid way."

    "One of the useful structures we can build with $\\texttt{pairs}$ is a $\\text{sequence}$—an ordered collection of data objects. There are, of course, many ways to represent sequences in terms of $\\texttt{pairs}$. One particularly straightforward representation is illustrated in Figure 2.4, where the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 is represented as a chain of pairs. The $\\texttt{car}$ of each pair is the corresponding item in the chain, and the $\\texttt{cdr}$ of the pair is the next pair in the chain. The $\\texttt{cdr}$ of the final pair signals the end of the sequence by pointing to a distinguished value that is not a pair, represented in $\\textrm{box-and-pointer}$ diagrams as a diagonal line and in programs as the value of the variable $\\textbf{nil}$.
